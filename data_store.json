It play the best known role in education for Students.  \nWhen  it was established,  its strength was smaller but with the passage of time, due  to Quality and the best \neducational system ,Students strength increased day by day .So by increasing the students strength , \nManagment  feeling difficulty to manage  all record in manual ways.  \n As Principal  have been using management information systems as in manual way, that  is time consuming \nand difficult as compare to the computerized management system.  \nBut now students strength is near about 1000,  Principal wants  to make use of information systems in the \ngradually -increasing daily management staffs.  \nWhat   the reasons  :Generally speaking, the reasons to use information systems can be stated as increasing \neffectiveness at work by processing information,  increasing managerial effectiveness by meeting the need \nfor information and gaining superiority in competitions  \nby directing strategies . \nWhy  to use it :  Secondary school management system has to handle records for many number of students \nand maintenance was difficult . Secondary school management system has to handle records for much \nnumber of students and maintenance was difficult .Through it has used an information system, it was \ntotally manual.  \nBeing at the beginning stage of the School Management Informati on Systems, computerization of the \nschool management is the basic subject of today\u2019s school management.  \n \nHow  to automate  school management system : \nThis project work automates school management system.  \nThe title of the project is \u201c GHALIAIN SECONDARY SCHOOL  MANAGEMENT SYSTEM \u201d. This \nproject will handle main activities  of the school.  \nThis project  has most of the facilities that a modern  school requires to computerize its day-to-day jobs.  It provides \nfacilities to keep the records of student, fees, teaching a nd  non-teaching staff with all  their  required details  along with all \nrequired record . It has facilities to generate various types of reports, which are  required  by  the  management during \nnormal business operations to operate the business effectively.  \nThis project  is comes under the  Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).  This application is \ndeveloped with the help of  C# language and works as Desktop Application.  \n \nThis project is developed using the tools, which are most suited for development of the Desktop \nApplication . These tools are as follows:  \n\uf0b7 Visual studio  (For front end)  \n\uf0b7 SQL SERVER  (For Database Storage as Back end)  \n \n \n \n\nBASIC PLA N: \nStudents Information:  Manage  All Students Information  \nBranches Information: Manage  All Branch Information   \nStaff Information: Manage All Staff Information  \nResults: Shown  Result about  Student Information  \nReports: Printing Reports Information  \n \nBASIC MODULES PLAN USED IN THE PR OJECT  \n This project includes the following modules for development of the project. These are as foll ows:  \n \n1. SPLASH FORM  \nThis is a first form that displays the welcome screen for the user and also shows the information of \ndeveloper or version etc.  \n  \n2. LOGIN FORM  \nThis form shows the Login name and password when user enter a valid user name and  password then \nhe/she can operate the application.  \n \n3. MAIN FORM  \nThis form is a menu -based form that displays the menu for operation of the application. It includ es \nvarious options for staff, student, fees and report related option.  \n \n4. STUDENT FORM  \n This form provides the option to add, modify, delete or find the information of a student who seeks the \nadmission in the school.  \n \n5.

RESULT  FORM  \nThis form displays the options for the user to add, delete and modify the details of student related to the \nmarks.  \n \n8. REPORT  FORM  \nWith the help of this option from menu user of the system can see or take the print out of various reports \nprovided by the system.  \n \n9. GOODBYE  FORM  \nThis form is activating when user select the exit option from menu or close the application. This form \nshows the good -bye message to the user and also say thanks to the user for using this application . \n \n \n \n \n  \n\nPROBLEM DEFINATION : \nProblem Statements : \nSecondary school management system has to handle records for many number of students and \nmaintenance was difficult .Through it has used an information system ,it was totally manual. Hence  There \nis a need to upgrade the system with a computer based informat ion system.  \nAs To help promote students achievement and success, schools must have access to complete, accurate , \nand timely information about students.  \nOne of the benefits of automated SMS is that the  student record system will simplify retrieval of requir ed \ninformation and is a great instrument for  school improvement by taking measures from the information \nacquired.  \nTeachers may want to associate a student with his parent or emergency persons for disciplinary  measures \nwhich need searching of the students r ecord in the record office. It has been difficult to  search a record \nfrom thousands of such records and observed that students can take any person  claiming that he/she is \ntheir parent or emergency person which creates problem in control of  students . \nProjec t Scope : \nScope of work Project will cover all areas related to Education institution  especially school.  The scope of \nschool management is very vast. It includes everything regarding the efficient functioning of the \neducational institution, securing the greatest benefit to the greatest number through an adoption of \npractical measures. It interprets and clarifies the functions and the activities of an educational progra m in \nfruitful relationships their mutual action. It ensures sound planning, good direction and efficient and \nsystematic execution.  \nToday In this competitive world every work has been computerized .Th e manual way of working has \nbecome very hectic, time consuming as well as difficult.
